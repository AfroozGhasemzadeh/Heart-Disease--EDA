# Heart-Disease-EDA
❤️ Heart Disease EDA — Outlier Detection & Feature Exploration
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset containing multiple clinical and lifestyle features.
The goal is to understand the structure of the data, detect noise and outliers, visualize important patterns, and explore which features may influence the presence of heart disease.
The notebook is designed to be clean, readable, and beginner‑friendly, with a focus on reproducibility and clear visualizations.
🎯 Objectives

Detect noise and outliers in the dataset
Visualize distributions of key features
Compare features between individuals with and without heart disease
Explore which variables show stronger patterns or associations
Prepare the dataset for future machine learning tasks
📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations
Distribution plots for numerical features
Boxplots for outlier detection
Correlation heatmap
Feature comparison grouped by heart disease outcome
Summary statistics and dataset overview
🧪 Techniques Used
Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
IQR method and visual inspection for outlier detection
Grouped analysis to compare outcomes
📚 Dataset
This project uses the Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle.
